@item A recursive '**' globbing syntax, akin for example to the globstar
option of the bash shell.
@item The ability to replace the filesystem functions used, in order to glob
on virtual filesystems.
@item Compatible with Python 2 and Python 3 (tested with 3.3).

It's currently based on the glob code from Python 3.3.1.")
