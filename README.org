This repository hosts some packages that can not be upstreamed.

Some definitions are ported from https://gitlab.com/genenetwork/guix-bioinformatics.

* Status

** Cuda
   Doesn't work yet, at least not in real pure environment. it seems some
   dynamic load path is messed up in the binary. If I omit testing in
   wrap-program, cuda builds all right, and *nvcc* can be used on host system,
   but it can not be used inside the environment of store.
   I am still trying to get all those dynamic load path right. How come the
   definition from nix looks some simple anyway?

** OpenCL
*** Working:
   + OpenCL headers.
   + _ocl-icd_
   + ClMath: _clBLAS_, _clFFT_
   + _boost_compute_

*** In repo but not working:
   + _beignet_ is *NOT* working

** Arrayfire
   The old cpu version is working.
