Numpy code. It can handle a large subset of Python's features, including loops,
ifs, recursion and closures, and it can even take derivatives of derivatives of
derivatives. It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation),
which means it can efficiently take gradients of scalar-valued functions with
respect to array-valued arguments, as well as forward-mode differentiation, and
the two can be composed arbitrarily. The main intended application of Autograd
is gradient-based optimization.")
