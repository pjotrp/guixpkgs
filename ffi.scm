    (description "pybind11 is a lightweight header-only library that exposes
C++ types in Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of
existing C++ code. Its goals and syntax are similar to the excellent
Boost.Python library by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate code in
traditional extension modules by inferring type information using compile-time
introspection.")
